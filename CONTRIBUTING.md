# Contibuting

This document should serve as a guideline for contributing to this repository and also serve as a basic git tutorial. This will provide the team with a single source for all the commonly use git commands.

## Getting Started

If you haven't cloned the repo yet this is how to do it. 

In general, change to a directory that is not already the directory of another github repository. I tend to keep all of my repositories in `~/Git` so the general setup is:
```
    cd Git
    git clone <url-of-repo>
```

**Important:** Do not attempt to clone a repository from within the same directory as another repostitory on your local machine. This will cause changes to the hidden `.git` file which will result in conflicts in both repositories.
