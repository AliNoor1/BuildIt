There are hundreds of ways of creating a unique shed on our site, with a number of options on changing the height of your structure, to its length and width. We also offer  a variety of windows and doors to accommodate the aesthetics of your shed. Through our diligent work, we continue to add more design options to make the possibilities endless.</p>

            <p>Post your design today, and have several contractors and builders contact you. Our contractor page wants to ease the process of finding a local builder. We created an algorithm to sort out the budget, location, and style of shed, to fit the needs on what the contractor is the most proficient at. No need to overpay or underpay on jobs, with our already calculated costs, and a buy-out cost, posted by the user. </p>
