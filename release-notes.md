# Release Notes

I propose we use this file on the `develop` branch to discuss everything that should go into the next working release. They finally released the instructions for [Milestone 2](https://moodle.cs.colorado.edu/pluginfile.php/77869/mod_resource/content/1/Milestone_Two_Requirements.pdf) on moodle. It looks like they want us to use some other project management software like trello for discussing project sprints. I still think it might be a good idea to keep track of what is going into the next working release right here on github, so please feel free to add to this file, I'm only trying to get it started.


## v0.0.1

I think the first tagged release just needs to be a minimally functional website but something slightly more functional than the splash page that we currently have. Maybe something along the lines of:

- HTML/CSS splash page
- funtional login page
    - database for users/contractors

### Notes from last meeting (2/21/2018):

Last meeting we discussed what each of us would begin researching:

- Jasper - research hosting options, research user authentication.

- Matt - look into home depot/ lowes api. Data base struct.
